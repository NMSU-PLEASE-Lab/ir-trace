Extracted loop bodies from embench-iot benchmark suite. We also apply a unrolling pass in case sizes are known.

Because we need to generate and run traces (to test for correctness) we can only run a single
loop iteration in a function. We don't have a interpreter runtime so we can't swap between traces
as different loop conditions are encountered. There's no way we can run a loop to completion, 
let alone an entire program.

Make sure to delete trace.txt when done
